# Turbulent channel flow with passive heat transfer at Pr = 0.71 #


Simulation is run at a constant bulk velocity (mass flow) targeting a Re_tau = 395

The reference data used for validation is that of Kawamura et al. (https://www.rs.tus.ac.jp/~t2lab/db/poi/text/Poi395_2nd_A_uhf071.dat)


The face coordinates of the stretched wall-normal grid used for the simulation is stored in 'zf.dat'. It is the same grid used in the reference data.

Note that the reference data was produced by a simulation conducted at a constant pressure gradient. As such, a slight Re_tau mismatch exists, with the CaNS case having a Re_tau = 396
